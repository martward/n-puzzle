N-puzzle
========

This repo will contain the n-puzzle app project, which is an assignment for Native App Studio.

The project will consist of an app which allows a user to play the n-puzzle game and select multiple pictures and difficulties

Features:
- Multiple difficulties (easy, medium and hard) which are represented by multiple sizes of the playing field (8, 15 or 24 tiles).
- Multiple images to choose from, as well as an option to play with numbers instead of a scrambled picture.
- A score which will be calculated based on the time needed to solve the puzzle, the number of moves made and the difficulty.
- The user will be able to restart the game while playing.
- Optionally: The player will be able to load his own pictures.

See the document images.docx for sketches of the app will look like.
