n-puzzle
========

This repo will contain the n-puzzle app project, which is an assignment for Native  App Studio.

The game will be played with three difficulties: easy, medium and hard. The difficulty is determined by the size of the playing field and number of tiles (8 tiles, 15 tiles or 25 tiles).

A score will be calculated after each finished game. This score will be determined by the time the player needed to solve the puzzle, the number of moves the player made and a multiplier (1, 2 or 4) that is determined by the difficulty.
