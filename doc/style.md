Names:

- all names of functions will be written in lowercase. 
  When a function name consists of more than one word, the words are seperated by a '_'.
  Eg: do_something(obj x)
- All constants will be written in uppercase and if the name consists of multiple words, 
  a '_' will be used to divide the words.
  E.g: NUM_TILES
- All other variables will be written with the camelback notation and the first letter in lowercase.
  E.g: thisVariable
- All classes will be written with the camelback notation and the first letter in uppercase.
  E.g: ThisClass

Style:

- Every block of code that is nested will be indented 4 spaces from the code it is nested within.
- Curly brackets are placed behind the code that will nest some other code, not on a new line.?
E.g:

function a_function(int x) {
    example
    example2
}

- i,j and k will be used as variables for loops.
- one-line comments will not use capitals for any words except proper nouns. 
  E.g: // no capitals except for names like Martijn.
