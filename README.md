n-puzzle
========

This repo will contain the n-puzzle app project, which is an assignment for Native  App Studio.

The game will be played with three difficulties: easy, medium and hard. The difficulty is determined by the size of the playing field and number of tiles (8 tiles, 15 tiles or 24 tiles).

A score will be calculated after each finished game. This score will be determined by the time the player needed to solve the puzzle, the number of moves the player made and a multiplier (1, 2 or 4) that is determined by the difficulty.

The puzzle itself will exist of numbers or parts of a picture which need to be ordered.
The user will be able to choose which of the pictures he/she wants to use or if he/she wants to use numbers.

On the home screen the user will be able to choose which picture to use, to change the difficulty and to exit the app.

Upon choosing a picture/the numbers, the app will show the the picture/right order, and then scramble.
Now the game will begin. The game is finished when all the tiles are in the correct place. 

When the game is finished the user will be congratulated and shown the score. He/she will then be able to either redo the puzzle (with a new random scramble) or to return to the home screen.

During the game the user will be able to enter a settings menu to change the difficulty (which wil restart the game with a new scramble with a different amount of tiles), to restart the game or to return to the home screen.
